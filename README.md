# University System Example

This example demonstrates how Jinaga could be used to model and run a university system. It shows how replication moves data to a client or service as needed. Even though the model is simplified, it contains enough complexity to show the principles of security and distribution within an immutable runtime.

## Model

Begin with a detailed description of the model. See the [University System Model](./university-model.ipynb) Polyglot Notebook.
